# capstone-teachers-pet-backend

Welcome to the server side of the Teacher's Pet app. Teacher's Pet supports elementary educators in schools, camps, clubs and daycares to provide fun and user- friendly games to boost class management through fun and routine. It hosts three built in games: a true or false game, a clean up game and a listening game, that will motivate students to engage, collaborate and problem solve. Along the way, you'll have the app's virtual pet, named Mojo, cheering you on.

# Note: 
This is the backend for the frontend of Teacher's Pet which you will also need to run the application. You can git clone that repo: `git@github.com:Jorfishdan/capstone.git` and follow the README at `https://github.com/Jorfishdan/capstone`
